# Experiments with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project involves exploring various machine learning algorithms using the scikit-learn library. It includes experiments with different datasets, model training, testing, and performance analysis.

## Features
- **Datasets**: Utilizes Penguin and Abalone datasets for experimentation.
- **Algorithms**: Implements Decision Trees and Multi-Layered Perceptrons.
- **Analysis**: Conducts statistical analysis to assess model performance variability.
- **Documentation**: Provides detailed analysis and presentation in Jupyter Notebook.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

## Skills Demonstrated
- Machine Learning Experimentation
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Training
- Performance Evaluation
- Statistical Analysis

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your local machine
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib


## Instructions to run both (Penguins & Abalone) Jupyter Notebooks

### Step[1]: Run the imports section 

### Step[2]: Run the data preparation section (The Datasets-Penguins) or (The Datasets-Abalone)

### Step[3]: Run the (Performance Measures) section of each model to generate the performance metrics of that model

### Step[4]: Run the (Re-run the Top-MLP code above 5 times) section to generate 5 runs of each model and calculate the performance measures for each run of each model

### Step[5]: Run the (Summarize Overall Averages of the 5 Runs) section that calculates the overall averages for each calculated performance metric of the 5 runs of each model

## Overview
This project involves exploring various machine learning algorithms using the scikit-learn library. It includes experiments with different datasets, model training, testing, and performance analysis.

## Features
- **Datasets**: Utilizes Penguin and Abalone datasets for experimentation.
- **Algorithms**: Implements Decision Trees and Multi-Layered Perceptrons.
- **Analysis**: Conducts statistical analysis to assess model performance variability.
- **Documentation**: Provides detailed analysis and presentation in Jupyter Notebook.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

## Skills Demonstrated
- Machine Learning Experimentation
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Training
- Performance Evaluation
- Statistical Analysis

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your local machine
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib

## Usage
1. **Load the Datasets**: The notebooks include instructions for loading the Penguin and Abalone datasets.
2. **Preprocess Data**: Follow the steps to preprocess the data for machine learning algorithms.
3. **Train Models**: Implement and train Decision Trees and Multi-Layered Perceptrons on the datasets.
4. **Analyze Results**: Conduct statistical analysis and visualize the results within the notebooks.

## Instructions to Run the Jupyter Notebooks
Follow these steps to run both the Penguin and Abalone Jupyter Notebooks:

1. **Run the imports section**.
2. **Run the data preparation section**:
    - For Penguins: Run the section titled "The Datasets-Penguins".
    - For Abalone: Run the section titled "The Datasets-Abalone".
3. **Run the "Performance Measures" section** of each model to generate the performance metrics of that model.
4. **Run the "Re-run the Top-MLP code above 5 times" section** to generate 5 runs of each model and calculate the performance measures for each run of each model.
5. **Run the "Summarize Overall Averages of the 5 Runs" section** that calculates the overall averages for each calculated performance metric of the 5 runs of each model.
